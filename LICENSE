ORIGINAL SIMPLE PIPELINE

This Dockerized version is based on the original Simple pipeline:
- Original Author: Guy Wachsman
- Original Repository: https://github.com/wacguy/Simple-1.8.1

The original Simple pipeline was developed for mapping EMS-induced point mutations 
using bulk segregant analysis. This Dockerized version maintains the same 
scientific methodology while providing improved usability and reproducibility.
